        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes – chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup golden raisins</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked basmati rice</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or frying pan.
            Once the oil is shimmering, add the chicken pieces and let them cook, undisturbed, for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.
        </li>

        <li>Saute for 3 minutes, or until the onions have softened</li>
        <li>
            Add the garlic, tomatoes, and raisins to the pan. Stir well, then add the rice and broth
        </li>

        <li>Allow the liquid to come to a boil, then cover the pan with a lid
            and turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook the rice for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and fluff the 
            rice with a fork. Re-cover the pan, and allow the rice to continue to steam for another 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
